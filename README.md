# Interpretable-Machine-Learning
Prioritizing genetic variants and factors that are relevant to explaining patientsâ€™ susceptibility to the COVID-19 virus is important to generate hypotheses for drug repurposing, identify individuals at unusually high or low risk, and contribute to global knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. Whole Exome Sequencing could provide insights about genetic factors modifying the interaction between the host (i.e. patients) and the virus. We expect to find a complex pattern of genetics factors interacting with the virus, if any at all. This is the reason why we think interpretable Machine learning Models could be of great help in identifying complexity and rare genetic disorder that predicts COVID-19 susceptibility among patients.
